Aspects of hardware that affect security include:

• security features that are built into a hardware itself;
• how the hardware is configured to protect against security issues;
• the security of the software runs directly on the hardware.

Security threats which affect hardware include malware and viruses that target the software that runs directly on the hardware. It also includes physical tampering, such as physical connection to the hardware to read data and implant malware.

Device security is just one aspect of security, and does not reflect the overall security status of the system and applications.</property>
